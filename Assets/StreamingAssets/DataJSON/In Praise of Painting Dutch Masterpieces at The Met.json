            "description": "Brilliant surfaces of metalwork and glass reflect lush fruits and a lobster in this still life. Heavily laden tables like this one, boasting both foodstuffs and imported luxuries such as the blue-and-white porcelain bowl from China, typify Dutch still life in the second half of the seventeenth century. Such paintings represent a shift away from the reminders of immortality and vanity in earlier still lifes and toward a wholehearted embrace of earthly pleasures.",

In the middle ground at left, nearly hidden in shadow, Moses strikes a rock to provide water for the Israelites during their flight from Egypt. But other figures such as the monumental bare-breasted woman with a water pitcher on her back overshadow the ostensible subject, revealing the painter’s priority to be the depiction of a variety of idealized bodies inspired by a dialogue with contemporary Italian art.",

After having two sons with her, Jason abandoned Medea, driving her to murder their children as well as his new bride. Bor shows Medea before this dreadful act, slumped in melancholy. The artist devoted careful antiquarian attention to the backdrop of a pagan altar adorned with garlands, an ox skull, and a smoldering lamp, but his Medea resembles an ordinary young woman, prompting empathy and identification on the part of beholders.",

The composition is asymmetrical, lopsided, and dynamic, and the young husband’s gesture of showing a pocket watch to his wife gives the portrait an element of storytelling. This emotionally convincing depiction of a nuclear family signals a break with the dynastic imagery of previous generations, although an older tradition persists in the three coats of arms clustered in the upper left-hand corner.",

The toppled glass, gap-toothed skull, and guttering wick of an oil lamp all serve as stark symbols of life’s brevity. Working with a limited palette of grays and browns, Claesz carefully describes the surfaces of these unsettling objects. By arranging them on a pitted stone ledge, the artist connects the picture’s space to our own, making the message all the more compelling.",

The older artist inspired his student’s lifelong commitment to self-portraiture, often in fanciful or theatrical costume. In some self-portraits, Dou adopted the guise of an aristocrat, but here he proudly displays the tools of his trade. Rather than adopt Rembrandt’s signature rough manner of painting, Dou became famous for his jewel-like surfaces and painstaking method, qualities that led Philips Angel to single him out as an exemplary artist in his lecture \"The Praise of Painting.\"",

Although the artist studied medieval monuments in preparing such scenes, the castle shown here is imaginary, pieced together from both observation and fantasy.",

They flank a richly dressed girl (probably a boy in drag, as women were not permitted to perform on these occasions). Still life elements litter the foreground, evoking both the traditional foods of the festival and an abundance of erotic innuendo.",

Haverman studied with the notoriously secretive flower painter Jan van Huysum and later gained admission to the Royal Academy in Paris, from which she was soon expelled for unknown reasons. The artist’s skill is on full display in this magnificent arrangement of flowers and fruit, in which she used innovative pigments such as Prussian blue. Over time, the organic yellow lake pigment has faded, resulting in the present blue appearance of the leaves.",

He was especially gifted as a painter of interiors--complex spatial arrangements stunningly beautiful in the manipulation of light. The Lehman picture is richly decorated with a marble floor and gilt-leather wall coverings, articulated by diffuse light from the window at left. The merry dialogue in the near ground is foiled by the mysterious encounter of a young man and elderly bearded figure in the antechamber and vestibule. De Hooch achieves extraordinary clarity and geometry in this grandly furnished chamber, qualities evocative of paintings he made in Amsterdam in the 1660s.",

Another beribboned gentleman tunes a viol, his sword cast off to the side, and a maid pauses in the doorway at the back with a tray of refreshments. For seventeenth-century viewers, symbolic elements such as the foot warmer would have indicated an atmosphere of indulgence and temptation.",

The recent removal of a synthetic varnish has revealed more of Rembrandt’s working method, showing for example how he flipped the brush to incise with its butt end the rough curls spilling out of his cap.",

Classicist critics particularly objected to Rembrandt’s realistic representation of the female body, declaring that the marks of garters could be seen on the legs of his figures from history or myth—see Bathsheba’s left calf here. Like much of the picture, the attendant arranging Bathsheba’s hair is badly abraded from past cleaning, but she may have been intended to represent a woman of African origin.",

Still, the somber coloration and rough paint handling make this work unmistakably Rembrandt’s own, and the goddess may be based in part on a portrait of the artist’s deceased wife, Saskia, who had been the muse and inspiration for many of his paintings.",

The richly clad Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) rests his hand pensively on a bust of Homer, the epic poet who had attained literary immortality with his Iliad and Odyssey centuries before. Aristotle wears a gold medallion with a portrait of his powerful pupil, Alexander the Great; perhaps the philosopher is weighing his own worldly success against Homer’s timeless achievement. Although the work has come to be considered quintessentially Dutch, it was painted for a Sicilian patron at a moment when Rembrandt’s signature style, with its dark palette and almost sculptural buildup of paint, was beginning to fall out of fashion in Amsterdam.",

Nothing is known about the man’s identity, and the inscription giving his age as forty is most likely by a later hand.",

He suffered from congenital syphilis, which caused him to go blind about 1690; he subsequently focused his energies on art theory. By the time this portrait was painted, in 1665, the ravaging effects of the disease were visible in his swollen features and bulbous nose. Recording his unfortunate appearance with an uncompromising directness, Rembrandt invested his subject with an air of quiet dignity. Although the sitter's theories on the ideal in painting were antithetical to Rembrandt's style, which Lairesse disparagingly likened to \"liquid mud on the canvas,\" the portrayal is a sympathetic one.",

To this day in the Netherlands, \"a household by Jan Steen\" remains proverbial for disorder and domestic chaos.",

He painted this image, most likely for a Catholic patron, while living in Amsterdam and engaged in regular fasting and other acts of devotion. In 1662 the artist joined a group of missionaries bound for Persia, although he was later dismissed from their company for his erratic behavior.",

While the toppled glass at left (now abraded with time) and rumpled table carpet may indicate a recently departed visitor, X-radiographs indicate that Vermeer chose to remove a male figure he had originally included standing in the door­way, heightening the painting’s ambiguity.",

A woman, representing the church itself, places one foot atop a globe, while, in the foreground, the cornerstone of the church crushes the serpent of evil. Vermeer converted to Catholicism before his marriage, and this painting, which includes a table laden with chalice, missal, and crucifix, may also refer to the celebration of the Mass in \"hidden churches\" within private homes. The Crucifixion scene in the background is based on a painting in Vermeer’s collection by the Flemish artist Jacob Jordaens.",

            "description": "Despite its profusion of realistic details, De Witte’s interior view of Delft’s Oude Kerk (Old Church) takes considerable liberties with the actual architecture of the church—omitting, for example, a grand sculpted pulpit from the central pier. In this whitewashed interior, heraldic emblems and civic banners have taken the places of the religious paintings and sculpture destroyed during the Iconoclasm. The young boys scribbling on the column and the urinating dog on the right show a strikingly irreverent attitude toward the sacred space, while a newly dug grave in the foreground provides a sobering reminder of mortality.",
