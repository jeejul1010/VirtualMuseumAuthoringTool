It is possible that he was inspired by a stay at Delft, where a cousin was a pastor of the Huguenot church. The painting in the background shows the interior of the Nieuwe Kerk there.",

            "Description": "In 1667 Ferdinand Bol painted several life-size portraits of Michiel de Ruyter. These were hung in the headquarters of all five Dutch admiralties. This painting went to Middelburg. De Ruyter’s hero status made him a powerful man. In the portrait he is richly dressed and holding his commander’s baton. Around his neck he is wearing the Order of St Michael, awarded to him by the King of France.",
